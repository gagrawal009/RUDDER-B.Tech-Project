# MCD411: B.Tech Project - RUDDER

*  Explored delayed rewards in reinforcement learning problems using the concept of return decomposition for delayed rewards.  
*  Analyzed and compared RUDDERâ€™s performance with traditional RL methods such as Monte Carlo and TD Learning.  
*  Built a complex delayed reward RL environment: 2D grid coin, and compared robustness of several RL methods on it
